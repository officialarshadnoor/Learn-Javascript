# Learn-Javascript
Learning Javascript from Scrach!

Today, We tried to cover up all the basic to medium level Javascript. Since, I previously worked on PHP (Laravel framwork) so I can understand the basics very well.

1. #Javascript Basics (Variable, Data types, String, Number, Template literals, Arrays, Null & Undefined, Boolean & Comparisions, Type Conversion, etc.)
2. #Control Flow (For loop, In & Of, While loop, Do while loop, If statements, Else if statements, Logical Operators, Logical Not Operators, Break & Continue, Swich Cases, Scope Global & Local, Ternary Operator, etc)
3. #Functions (Arguments & Parameters, Returning values, Arrow functions, Functions & Methods, For each method, etc.)
4. #Object Literals (Methods, this keyword, object in arrays, math object, primitive vs reference, etc.)


It took me 8 hours to watch and practice all the concepts.. Happy sunday :)
